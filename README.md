# Responsive-Student-Login-and-Register-
The website features a clean and responsive design with a navigation bar for easy access to Home, About, and Contact pages. The main highlight is the user authentication system, offering a login form with email and password inputs. Additionally, there is a registration form spread across multiple slides, capturing detailed information such as email, password, username, mobile number, college name, graduation year, CGPA, domain preferences, expected salary, and the option to upload a resume.

The registration process is divided into five steps, each represented by a distinct slide. Users can navigate through these slides using forward and backward buttons. The website incorporates icons from Ionicons for a visually appealing interface. The registration form also includes checkboxes for agreeing to terms and conditions. The overall design is enhanced with CSS styles and utilizes external CSS and JavaScript files for maintainability.
